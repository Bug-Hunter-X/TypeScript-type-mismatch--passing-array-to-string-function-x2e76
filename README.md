This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript where type mismatches can go unnoticed during compilation, leading to runtime errors. The code passes an array to a function expecting a string.  The TypeScript compiler does not catch this error, highlighting a potential weakness in type checking. The solution demonstrates how to use type guards or type assertions to enforce correct type handling and prevent the runtime error.
